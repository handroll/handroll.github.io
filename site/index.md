### A website generator for software artisans

handroll is a website generator designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use.
The concept is very straightforward: you make content in your favorite format
and handroll makes HTML out of it.

Want to make a blog using [Markdown][md]? No problem. How about a personal
website in [reStructuredText][rst]? Sure thing. Maybe [Textile][text] is more
your style. You're good.

Who is this for?
----------------

handroll is for people who want to use plain text editors to make websites.
That group could include programmers, students, scientists, writers, poets,
bloggers, and more.

handroll is a command line tool. In almost all cases, you will only ever need
to type `handroll`, but a rudimentary level of comfort with a command line
terminal is desired.

What can it do?
---------------

TODO: Document the features. See [the developer documentation feature
list](http://handroll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#features) for now.

How much?
---------

handroll is free and open source software. That means no cost to you. The tool
is made available under the [BSD license][bsd]. In layman's terms, this roughly
means you can do whatever you want with this software except hold the
developers liable for anything.

basic information correct first before making it look pretty.

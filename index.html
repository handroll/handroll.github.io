<h3>A website generator for software artisans</h3>
<p>handroll is a website generator designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use.
The concept is very straightforward: you make content in your favorite format
and handroll makes HTML out of it.</p>
<p>Want to make a blog using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>? No problem. How about a personal
website in <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>? Sure thing. Maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29">Textile</a> is more
your style. You're good.</p>
<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<p>handroll is for people who want to use plain text editors to make websites.
That group could include programmers, students, scientists, writers, poets,
bloggers, and more.</p>
<p>handroll is a command line tool. In almost all cases, you will only ever need
to type <code>handroll</code>, but a rudimentary level of comfort with a command line
terminal is desired.</p>
<h2>What can it do?</h2>
<p>TODO: Document the features. See <a href="http://handroll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#features">the developer documentation feature
list</a> for now.</p>
<h2>How much?</h2>
<p>handroll is free and open source software. That means no cost to you. The tool
is made available under the <a href="https://github.com/handroll/handroll/blob/master/LICENSE">BSD license</a>. In layman's terms, this roughly
means you can do whatever you want with this software except hold the
developers liable for anything.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is to install handroll from a terminal.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>pip install handroll
</pre></div>

<h2>More information</h2>
<p>TODO: Link all the things!</p>
<p>TODO: Do not fear! Substance before style. This website is trying to get the
basic information correct first before making it look pretty.</p>

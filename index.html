<h3>A website generator for software artisans</h3>
<p>handroll is a website generator designed to be simple and fast. The concept is
easy: you make content in your favorite format and handroll makes HTML out of
it.</p>
<p>Want to make a blog using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>? No problem. How about a personal
website in <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>? Sure thing. Maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29">Textile</a> is more
your style. You're good.</p>
<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
<p>handroll is for people who want to use plain text editors to make websites.
That group could include programmers, students, scientists, writers, poets,
and more.</p>
<p>handroll is a command line tool. In almost all cases, you will only ever need
to type <code>handroll</code>, but a basic comfort level with a command line terminal is
desired.</p>
<h2>What can it do?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Generate HTML from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a>, or
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29">Textile</a>.</li>
<li>Generate CSS from <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.</li>
<li>Generate an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom XML</a> feed.</li>
<li>Run a <a href="http://handroll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/server.html">development server</a> to update as you work.</li>
<li>Translated into Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese,
  and Spanish.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a full list of features in the
<a href="http://handroll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#features">developer documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>How much?</h2>
<p>handroll is free and open source software. That means no cost to you. The tool
is made available under the <a href="https://github.com/handroll/handroll/blob/master/LICENSE">BSD license</a>. In layman's terms, the
developers aren't liable for anything.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is to install handroll from a terminal.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>pip install handroll
</pre></div>


<p>After installing, make a directory for your project. Add a <a href="http://handroll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/templates.html">template</a>
or <a href="http://handroll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html">configuration file</a> to show handroll that your new directory is a
handroll project. Then you are free to start adding whatever content you want.</p>
<p>You can generate your site by running <code>handroll</code> or let handroll watch your
work and update as you go by using <code>handroll --watch</code> (see <a href="http://handroll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/server.html">Development
Server</a>).</p>
